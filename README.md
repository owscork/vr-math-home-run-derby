Built a virtual reality video game in Unity, originally developed to be played with the Oculus Quest 2 and modified to be played as a 2D web game hosted through WebGL, 
where the player participates in a homerun derby that requires a correct answer to a basic math equation prior to each pitch. Incorrect answers resulted in ground-outs and correct 
answers resulted in homeruns, if the player makes contact with the pitch.
