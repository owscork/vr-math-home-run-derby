## About the Project

Built a virtual reality video game in Unity, originally developed to be played with the Oculus Quest 2 and modified to be played as a 2D web game hosted through WebGL, 
where the player participates in a homerun derby that requires a correct answer to a basic math equation prior to each pitch. Incorrect answers resulted in ground-outs and correct 
answers resulted in homeruns, if the player makes contact with the pitch.

This was my first time using Unity to build a game in VR, so aesthetics & graphics were not major areas of focus whereas the functionality & completion of a working playable virtual reality game were. The project was also given a deadline of two weeks from assignment to build, so only what was necessary for a working demo was completed.
